AOC 2024
========

I will probably have a go at doing it mostlly in haskell this year and maybe a bit of zig.

I still haven't managed to get any sort of haskell workflow working nicely in nix, but I'll hopefully manage to finally get that figured out by the weekend so I don't have to write everything from scratch myself.

in the meantime:
`$ nix-shell -p ghc`

`./all.sh`
